Abstract: X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) plays an important role for elemental analysis in a wide
range of scientific fields, especially in cultural heritage. XRF imaging, which uses a raster scan to
acquire spectra pixel-wise across artworks, provides the opportunity for spatial analysis of pigment
distributions based on their elemental composition. However, conventional XRF-based pigment iden-
tification relies on time-consuming elemental mapping facilitated by the interpretation of measured
spectra by experts. To reduce the reliance on manual work, recent studies have applied machine
learning techniques to cluster similar XRF spectra in data analysis and to identify the most likely
pigments. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to implement automatic pigment identification strate-
gies to directly tackle the complex structure of real paintings, e.g. pigment mixtures and layered
pigments. In addition, pigment identification based on XRF on a pixel-by-pixel basis remains an
obstacle due to the high noise level. Therefore, we developed a deep-learning based pigment identi-
fication framework to fully automate the process. In particular, this method offers high sensitivity to
the underlying pigments and to the pigments present in low concentrations, therefore enabling robust
mapping of pigments based on single-pixel XRF spectra. As case studies, we applied our framework
to lab-prepared mock-up paintings and two 19th-century paintings: Paul Gauguin’s Poèmes Barbares
(1896) that contains layered pigments with an underlying painting, and Paul Cezanne’s The Bathers
(1899-1904). The pigment identification results demonstrated that our model achieved comparable
results to the analysis by elemental mapping, suggesting the generalizability and stability of our
mode
